<h1><b>David Ihejirika</b></h1>
<p>My experience in Dewitt Clinton Highschool has been very <i>interesting</i> to say the least as I see a lot of oppurtunities in the school. <u>The atmosphere of children is filled with people who care but many who </u> <b>dont</b> take advantage of the many oppurtunities that are in the school that make me question, but it is what it is. I find delight in being able to pick what I want to do in this school especially with what will help me in the future like in my career or just overall knowledge of life.</p>

<p><i>in 3 years</i>, I see myself as a Software Engineer or Data analyst, it may be specific but I dont mind doing a job with computer science so as long as I know I will be able to do that job to <b>the best of my ability</b> and I feel that as soon as I am done with highschool and college <u>I will be able to attain such goal or even be able to do it while in school.</u></p>
